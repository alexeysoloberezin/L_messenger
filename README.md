# L_messanger

## _Next chat messenger

I developed the PC version of L_messanger as I wanted to explore new concepts in the Next.js framework, particularly focusing on real-time capabilities in a chat application.

### Technologies Used

- **Next (Next auth):** For building the application and handling authentication.
- **MongoDB:** Used as the database for storing application data.
- **Prisma:** A modern database toolkit for TypeScript and Node.js, integrated into the project.
- **Pusher:** Employed for real-time communication and updates in the chat.
- **Zustand:** State management library for React applications, enhancing the application's state handling.
- **Tailwind:** Used for styling the application, ensuring a clean and responsive design.
- **TypeScript:** Leveraged TypeScript throughout the project for a more robust and scalable codebase.

> Note: The focus of this project was on learning technical aspects, so I didn't prioritize CSS and adaptability considerations.
